# [slush](https://github.com/slushjs/slush)-ng-app [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jonkemp/slush-ng-app.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jonkemp/slush-ng-app)

> Generator for AngularJS web apps using [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) and Gulp


## Getting Started

Install `slush-ng-app` globally:

```bash
$ npm install -g slush-ng-app
```

### Usage

Create a new folder for your project:

```bash
$ mkdir my-slush-ng-app
```

Run the generator from within the new folder:

```bash
$ cd my-slush-ng-app && slush ng-app
```

Once you run the generator, you will not need to run `npm install` or `bower install` as that is done automatically by the generator. See the [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) docs for more information.

## Getting To Know Slush

Slush is a tool that uses Gulp for project scaffolding.

Slush does not contain anything "out of the box", except the ability to locate installed slush generators and to run them with liftoff.

To find out more about Slush, check out the [documentation](https://github.com/klei/slush).
